# Decision record — supercell tiling and the Hamiltonian memory layout

Status: landed (M1). Owner: `src/hamiltonian.jl`, `src/energy.jl`;
gates in `test/unit/test_hamiltonian.jl`, `test/unit/test_energy.jl`.

## T1 — unfold `MultipoleTerm.shifts`, one instance per (term, cell)

`multipole_terms(model)` emits every directed cluster member once, with per-site
integer **training-cell** lattice translations `shifts` (`shifts[1] = 0` anchored —
verified in SCEFitting: orbit members retain the anchored candidate-cluster shifts).
Tiling onto `dims = (N₁, N₂, N₃)` is pure integer bookkeeping:

```
for every supercell cell t and every term:
    member i sits at site_index(atoms[i], mod.(t + shifts[i], dims))
```

Toroidal (periodic) boundary conditions; no ½ / 1/N factors (the introspection
contract already makes terms plain summands, `Σ terms = predict_energy − intercept`).
Site indexing is atom-fastest, cells column-major:
`site = atom + n_cell_atoms·(c₁ + N₁(c₂ + N₂c₃))`, so `site_atom(s) = mod1(s,
n_cell_atoms)` is the sublattice id.

Consequences pinned by machine-precision gates:

- `dims = (1,1,1)` degenerates to the training cell exactly:
  `total_energy == predict_energy − intercept` (1e-12).
- A periodically replicated configuration has exactly `prod(dims) ×` the cell energy.
- Tiling **replicates** the fitted finite-range couplings; it does not manufacture
  longer-range physics the training cell could not resolve.

## T2 — distinct member *sites*, not distinct atoms

The exact single-spin ΔE (`ΔE = c_s·ΔZ`) needs each instance to touch a site at most
once, so `site_coeffs!`'s leave-one-out vector is independent of that site's spin.
The invariant is checked per term at the **site level under the actual `dims`**:
`(atomᵢ, mod.(shiftsᵢ, dims))` pairwise distinct (the wrapped relative pattern is
cell-independent, so cell 0 covers all instances).

- Minimum-image fitted models (the default) have distinct atoms per cluster outright
  (SCEFitting drops reused-atom clusters in enumeration) → valid for any `dims`.
- `AllImages` (spin-spiral) models may legitimately couple an atom to its own
  periodic image (`atoms = [a, a]`, `shifts = [0, R]`). These tile fine when `dims`
  keeps the images distinct sites, and are **rejected with a clear error** when the
  wrap folds them together (e.g. `dims = (1,1,1)`) — enlarging `dims` is the fix.
  Gate: the hand-built ±x self-image chain (`test_hamiltonian.jl`).

## T3 — memory: templates once + compact CSR instances

`ScaledTerm` templates hold each fitted term's `folded` payload **once** (with the
`(4π)^(body/2)` scale applied there — the package's single application site);
instances are integer CSR lists (`inst_term`, `inst_ptr`/`inst_sites`) plus a
per-site adjacency (`site_ptr`/`site_inst`/`site_slot`, and a `site_has_l1` mask for
the overrelaxation axis). This is the SpinClusterMC lesson: duplicating per-instance
payloads is what blew that package to multi-GB caches; the index-only layout costs
≈ 13 MB for the Nd₂Fe₁₄B l02 case (4692 terms, 4×4×4, 4352 sites, 300k instances).

Rejected alternative — fully on-the-fly instance reconstruction (no instance list):
saves the MB but puts mod-arithmetic and shift resolution inside the innermost ΔE
loop, and is much harder to test in isolation. The CSR adjacency also precomputes
each site's member slot, replacing the `findfirst` of the SCETools single-cell
kernel.

## T4 — the 4-function energy contract

Everything above the Hamiltonian touches energy only through
`total_energy` / `site_coeffs!` / `delta_energy` / `site_gradient` — the seam a
future kernel optimization (e.g. body-grouped instance batches) must preserve.
`site_gradient` uses `Harmonics.grad_Zlm_unsafe` (on-sphere, tangent-projected;
`e·∇E = 0`) and is diagnostics/tests only.

## T5 — precompiled sparse contraction programs (the hot-kernel form)

The rank-generic contraction — `CartesianIndices` over the rank-erased
`ScaledTerm.folded` behind a rank-specialized function barrier — costs a **dynamic
dispatch and 2–3 heap allocations per instance per visit**, which made `site_coeffs!`
~85–90 % of every sweep on the Nd₂Fe₁₄B bench fixture (bench_log baseline,
2026-07-14). The constructor therefore flattens each template once into
`_ContractionPrograms`: per (template, member slot) a *site program* — the nonzero
`folded` entries as flat arrays of premultiplied weight `coef·folded[idx]`, target
row `lm_index(ls[slot], μ_slot)`, and factor (row, member-slot) pairs — and per
template an *energy program* (every slot a factor, raw `folded[idx]` weights, the
coef applied to the per-instance entry sum). The hot kernels only index plain
`Int32`/`Int8`/`Float64` arrays: no dispatch, no allocation, no zero-entry
scanning, no `lm_index` recomputation.

**Bitwise contract**: the programs are flattened in the reference kernels' exact
loop order — `CartesianIndices` column-major entries, ascending member slots, the
kernels' own zero-skip predicates (`coef·folded == 0` site / `folded == 0` energy),
and the same operation order (`(coef·folded)·p` site / `coef·Σ w·p` energy) — so
the program kernels reproduce the rank-generic reference kernels (kept at the
bottom of `energy.jl` as the readable spec) **bit for bit**. Trajectories, fixed-seed
tests, and checkpoints are unaffected — this is a pure-speed change, not a
P6-breaking one. Gate: `test_energy.jl` "program kernels ≡ reference kernels
(bitwise)" (body 1/2/3, isotropic + anisotropic + self-image shift + sparse
tensors, `==` on `_total_energy` and on `site_coeffs!` for every site).

**Pair fast path** (`site_col`/`pent_row`, 2026-07-15). A body-2 template's site
program has exactly one factor per entry and it always references the same member
slot (the other one), so the neighbor column is constant across the program. Both
remaining indirections are precomputed — `site_col[j]` holds the hoisted neighbor
column per adjacency entry (0 → general path) and `pent_row[e]` the single factor
row per entry — and `site_coeffs!` walks purely sequential streams plus the one
`zrows` gather. This stays inside the bitwise contract (`p = 1.0·z ≡ z` in IEEE
754, same zero-skip, same accumulation order; the run-level fingerprint matched
HEAD byte-for-byte) and cut `site_coeffs!` roughly in half on the Nd₂Fe₁₄B fixture
(bench_log #5). An adjacency *locality sort* (program-id or neighbor-site order)
was measured first and does nothing (≤2 % — the program arrays fit in L2; the cost
is the per-entry indirection chain, not capacity misses).

Memory: programs are per *template* (not per instance) — `Σ_terms body·nnz(folded)`
site entries plus `nnz` energy entries, a few MB even for the Nd₂Fe₁₄B case —
consistent with T3's templates-once rule. The pair tables add one `Int32` per
adjacency entry (`site_col` — the same asymptotics as the CSR adjacency itself)
and one per site-program entry (`pent_row`). The templates themselves stay stored
(introspection, `_site_energy_scale`, the checkpoint fingerprint, the reference
kernels).
