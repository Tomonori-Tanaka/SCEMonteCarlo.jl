# Design notes

Home for design discussions, investigations, and the performance backlog.
`DESIGN_NOTES.md` at the repository root is the index; each topic body lives
here as one file.

## When to use which directory

| Location | Contents | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/specs/` | Decision records (`<topic>.md`, cited from source) and development units (`[YYMMDD]-[slug]/`) | `docs/specs/updates-stationarity.md` |
| `docs/design-notes/` | Pre-spec design discussions, investigations, backlog | this directory |
| `docs/src/` | User-facing docs built by Documenter | `docs/src/api.md` |

## File naming

- English kebab-case (`<topic>.md` or `<topic>-<aspect>.md`).
- No date prefix (topic-first; the timestamp lives in the in-file
  `Status:` line).
- One topic per file. Post-mortem materials (investigations, benchmarks,
  adoption assessments) go under `investigations/`.

## Operating rules

1. **New topic**: create `docs/design-notes/<topic>.md` and add a row to
   `DESIGN_NOTES.md`.
2. **When the topic becomes a spec**: point the `DESIGN_NOTES.md` row at the
   new `docs/specs/...` path. The design-note body stays in place only while
   the spec is active.
3. **When the spec completes**: delete the design-note file and remove its
   row from `DESIGN_NOTES.md`. The spec folder is the canonical history; git
   preserves the original body.
4. **Length**: if a single file exceeds ~500 lines, consider splitting.

## Internal references

Do not reference files in this directory from `.jl` source (CLAUDE.md rule).
This directory is Claude-collaboration scaffolding; source code must read
independently.
